# Stage 5/5: Visualize it!
# Steps 1-8 are the same as in the previous stage.
# Requirements:
# 1.    Read the CSV files with datasets.
# 2.    Change the column names.
#       The column names of the sports and prenatal tables must match the column names of the general table.
# 3.    Merge the data frames into one. Use the ignore_index = True parameter
#       and the following order: general, prenatal, sports.
# 4.    Delete the Unnamed: 0 column.
# 5.    Delete all the empty rows.
# 6.    Correct all the gender column values to f and m respectively.
# 7.    Replace the NaN values in the gender column of the prenatal hospital with f.
# 8.    Replace the NaN values in the bmi, diagnosis, blood_test, ecg, ultrasound, mri, xray, children, months columns
#       with zeros.
# 9.    Answer questions 1-3. Output the answers in the specified format.
#       The answers to the first two questions should be formatted as in the examples.
#       No special form is required to answer the third question
# Questions:
# 1.    What is the most common age of a patient among all hospitals?
#       Plot a histogram and choose one of the following age ranges: 0 - 15, 15 - 35, 35 - 55, 55 - 70, or 70 - 80
# 2.    What is the most common diagnosis among patients in all hospitals? Create a pie chart
# 3.    Build a violin plot of height distribution by hospitals. Try to answer the questions.
#       What is the main reason for the gap in values? Why there are two peaks,
#       which correspond to the relatively small and big values? No special form is required to answer this question.
# Example:
# >The answer to the 1st question: 0 - 15
# >The answer to the 2nd question: flu
# >The answer to the 3rd question: It's because...
