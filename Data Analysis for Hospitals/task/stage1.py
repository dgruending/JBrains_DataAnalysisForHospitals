#       pd.set_option('display.max_columns', 8)
#       It sets the number of columns, which pandas lets to display in the terminal.
#       Unfortunately, this number differs occasionally and causes problems in the tests, so we need to fix the number.
# 2.    Read 3 CSV files containing the datasets
# 3.    Print the first 20 rows of each data frame. Use the following order: 'general', 'prenatal', 'sports'

def main():
